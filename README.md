Patterned Wallpapers
====================

*Get a new patterned-wallpaper automatically every day.*

gnome-shell-extension-patterns is a [GNOME Shell](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeShell) extension which automatically sets every day a new patterned-wallpaper created by the [COLOURlovers](http://www.colourlovers.com/) community.

It was enspired by the [Pattrn](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.lucasr.pattrn) Android app, created by @[lucasr](https://github.com/lucasr).

Installation
============

 1. Clone it into your *$HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/* directory
 2. Enable it using **gnome-shell-extension-prefs** or **gnome-tweak-tool**

**It will be uploaded to http://extensions.gnome.org as soon as some important features are implemented (see [issues](https://github.com/felipeborges/gnome-shell-extension-patterns/issues))**
